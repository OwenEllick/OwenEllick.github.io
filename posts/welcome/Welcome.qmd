This is the first post in my Quarto blog. Welcome!

I am Owen Ellick and I am currently a Sophomore Data Analtytics major with a Minor in Finance. I play on the Men's Lacrosse team here at Geneseo. I enjoy playing sports specifically football,lacrosse, and golf. My plan for when I graduate from Geneseo is to travel Europe for a short period of time and then get a job doing data analysis in the sports industry. My favorite football team is the New York Jets and my favorite hockey team is the Washington Capitals. I enjoy spending time with my friends and family as they are a huge part of my life.

Picture of my favorite football team!
Being of fan of this team has its ups and downs. It allows you to be apart of a culture and fanbase that is bigger than yourself. However recent struggles make being a fan of this team rough, but I know in the end one day they will get it done.

The photo above is me playing in a lacrosse game for SUNY Geneseo against Nazareth University on February 25,2023. It was really cold and snowy, but we managed to come out with the win 13-11.

I hope you learned a little bit about me!
