# Python Basics

## Variables Are Names, Not Places

-   A value is datum (literal) such as a number or text

-   There are different types of values:

    -   352.3 is known as a float or double;

    -   22 is an integer;

    -   "Hello World!" is a string.

```{python}
list_example = [10, 1.23, "like this", True, None]
print(list_example)
type(list_example)
```

-   The most. basic built-in data types that we'll need to know about are:
    -   integers, 10
    -   floats, 1.23
    -   strings, "like this"
    -   booleans, True
    -   nothing, None
-   Python also has a built-in type of data container called a list (ex. \[10,15,20\]) that can contain anything, even different types

## Values, Variables, and Types

```{python}
a = 10
print(a)
```

-   A variable is a name that refers to a value.
    -   We can think of a variable as a box that has a value, or multiple values, packed inside it
-   A variable is just a name!
-   Sometimes you will hear variables referred to as objects.
-   Everything that is not a literal value, such as 10, is an object

## Assignment (=)

```{python}
# Here we assign the integer value 5 to the variable x.
x = 5   

# Now we can use the variable x in the next line.
y = x + 12  
y
```

-   In Python, we use = to assign a value to a variable
-   In math, = means equality of both sides
-   In programs, = means assignment: assign the value on the right side to the variable on the left side.
-   In programming code, everything on the right side needs to have a value.
    -   The right side can be a literal value, or a variable that has already been assigned a value, or a combination.
-   When Python reads y= x + 12, it does the following:
    1.  Sees the = in the middle.
    2.  Knows that this is an assignment.
    3.  Calculates the right side (gets the value of the object referred to by x and adds it to 12).
    4.  Assigns the result to the left-side variable, y.

## Code and Comment Style

-   The two main principles for coding and managing data are:
    -   Make things easier for your future self.
    -   Don't trust your future self.
-   The \# mark is Google Colab's comment character
    -   The \# character has many names: hash, sharp, pound, or octothorpe.

    -   \# indicates that the rest of the line is to be ignored.

    -   Write comments before the line that you want the comment to apply to.
-   Consider adding more comments on code cells and their results using text cells.

## Brackets

-   There are several kinds of brackets in Python, including \[\], {}, and ().

```{python}
vector = ['a', 'b']
vector[0]
```

-   \[\] is used to denote a list or to signify accessing a position using an index

```{python}
{'a', 'b'}  # set
{'first_letter': 'a', 'second_letter': 'b'}  # dictionary
```

-   {} is used to denote a set or a dictionary (with key-value pairs)

```{python}
num_tup = (1, 2, 3)
sum(num_tup)
```

-   () is used to denote
    -   a tuple, or
    -   the arguments to a function, ex. function(x) where x is the input passed to the function

## Question 1

-   Using Python operations only, calculate below:

```{python}
(2**5/(7*(4-2**3)))
```

## Question 2

-   For each expression below, what is the value of the expression? Explain thoroughly.

```{python}
20 == '20'
```

-   This is saying 20 is not equal to '20' because they are different data types (int vs string)

```{python}
x = 4.0
y = .5
z = 3*y - x

x < y or 3*y < x
```

-   This says the expression is true since 3\*.5 \< 4

## Question 3

```{python}
fare = "$10.00"
tip = "2.00$"
tax = "$ 0.80"
```

-   Write a Python code that uses slicing and the print() function to print out the following message:

    -   The total trip cost is: \$12.80

```{python}
total =fare = "$10.00"
tip = "2.00$"
tax = "$ 0.80"
total = fare[0:2] + tip[0] + tax[3:6]
print("The total trip cost is:", total)

#The total trip cost is: $12.80The total trip cost is:", total)
```

## Question 4

```{python}
list_variable = [100, 144, 169, 1000, 8]
```

-   Write a Python code that uses print() and max() functions to print out the largest value in the list, list_variable, as follows:

    -   The largest value in the list is: 1000

```{python}
list_variable = [100,144,169,1000,8]
x =max(list_variable)
print('The largest value in the list is:',x)

#The largest value in the list is: 1000
```

## Question 5

-   Import the pandas library as pd.
-   Install the itables package.
-   From itables, import the function init_notebook_mode and show.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
!pip install itables
from itables import init_notebook_mode
from itables import show
```
